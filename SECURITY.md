Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. Do not create a public GitHub issue. Instead, contact the maintainer directly or open a private security report.
2. Provide a clear summary, steps to reproduce, and a suggested fix or mitigation.
3. If an urgent fix is required, maintainers will coordinate disclosure and release.

For non-sensitive issues, open a regular issue and tag it `security`.
